This project was assigned to test our understanding of material on graphs and Depth First Search.
It takes in a series of inputs from stdin and outputs an adjacensy list

Issues with this code so far: I haven't figured out how to correctly take in input and put it into the right dict. 

SAMPLE RUN: 

INPUT:                          
2                                   
3                                  
A B 
B A 
C 
4 
1 2 
2 1 3  
3 2 4 
4 3 



OUTPUT:
A B C 
1 2 3 4
